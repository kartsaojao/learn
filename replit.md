# C++ Vector Example Project

## Overview
This is a simple C++ console application that demonstrates vector operations and memory management. The project showcases:
- Vector initialization and manipulation
- Memory address visualization
- Size type usage
- C++03 compatible code

## Project Structure
- `main.cpp` - Main source file with vector demonstrations
- `Makefile` - Build configuration using g++ with C++03 standard
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules for C++ build artifacts

## Build System
The project uses a Makefile with the following configuration:
- Compiler: g++
- Standard: C++03
- Flags: `-std=c++03 -Wall -g`

## Running the Project
The workflow is configured to:
1. Build the project using `make`
2. Execute the compiled `main` binary

Simply click the Run button to see the output demonstrating vector operations.

## Recent Changes
- **2025-11-07**: Initial Replit setup
  - Installed C/C++ toolchain (c-clang)
  - Configured build workflow
  - Updated .gitignore to exclude `main` executable
  - Verified successful compilation and execution
